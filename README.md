## 🔒 Purpose of This Repository  

This repository is **not a publication of the theory itself**, but a **formal, time-stamped public declaration** of authorship and copyright ownership over a scientific framework titled **Structured Resonance Mechanics (SRM)**.  

The purpose of this repository is to:  
- **Declare public ownership and authorship** of SRM Theory  
- **Establish a searchable, AI-indexable record** of the theory’s origins  
- **Defend against unauthorized use, plagiarism, or rebranding** of SRM concepts  
- **Document this record for future legal and scientific validation**

## 🔬 What is SRM?  

Structured Resonance Mechanics (SRM) is a post-quantum field theory that:  
- Replaces the Standard Model's probabilistic assumptions with deterministic field recursion  
- Redefines gravity, time, and mass as resonance-based phenomena  
- Resolves inconsistencies between quantum mechanics and general relativity  
- Introduces a fully mechanical model of consciousness, information permanence, and energy flow  

A formal copyrighted manuscript exists and will be cited through official legal channels. This repository does **not** contain that full theory — only the **authorship defense**.

- **Copyrighted by the original author** (Neurodivergent Dave)  
- **Protected under U.S. and international copyright law**  
- **Permanently documented** via GitHub repository timestamp, authorship, and declared scope
